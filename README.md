# Computer-Graphics-Projects
This repository contains a series of computer graphics related projects of completed.

I'd say the most visually pleasing is the project titled GeneralFractal, which is an implementation of
various 3D fractals derived from the Sierpinski tetrahedron. 

Computationally speaking, the RayTracer and LSystem are pretty cool. Neither or very sophisticated. The 
projects were completed for exploritory purposes.
